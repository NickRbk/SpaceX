## SpaceX project


#### Description
This app has been made by SOLID principles using combination 
of interface, enum, abstract and inner class, inheritance etc.

#### How to start up ?
- git clone
- compile App.java by ```javac App.java```
- start app with ```java App [int tankVolume] [int rocketCapacity] [String destination]```

#### The app expected 3 arguments: 
```int tankVolume```, ```int rocketCapacity```, ```String destination```

For destination you can write Mars or Moon...Other directions in progress\)

### So, for example, you run app as
```java App 130 70 Mars```

If you haven't enough fuel, app say that Rocket crashed and 
how many additional fuel you needed to success fly
