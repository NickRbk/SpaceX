## rocket.SpaceX project


#### Description
This app has been made by SOLID principles using combination 
of interface, enum, inner class, inheritance etc.

#### How to start up ?
- git clone dev branch
- compile App.java by ```javac App.java```
- start app with ```java App```

#### The app expected 3 arguments: 
```int tankVolume```, ```int rocketCapacity```, ```String destination```
For destination you can write Mars or Moon...Other directions in progress\)

### So, for example, you run app as
```java App 130 70 Mars```

If you haven't enough fuel, app say about that\)
